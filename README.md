# OpenGL World

This is study project for course "Computer Graphics" @ Afeka College of Engineering.

The project goal is to write an OpenGL 3D game based on work done in classes.

* Generated terrain
* Building mode (F3) to create hills, valleys, roads (bridges) and place cities
* User-driven car (Controls: w,a,s,d) 
* Self-driven cars
* Different camera modes : F1 - global camera (Controls: left,light,up,down,page up, page down), F2 - driver view

## Implementation Highlights

* C++
* OOP
* OpenGL / GLUT
